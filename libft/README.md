## Technologies

Project is created with:
* gcc 9.3.0

## Description

The aim of the project is the create a scalable library for C and fill it with basic and reusable functions. These functions will be used throughout the cursus and other projects.\
It is also a good habit of adding functions with each new project. So this repository will be up, maintained and updated with new functions on a regular basis.  

## Installation

Just pull the project in the repository where your project is !\
Then, compile your own project with "./libft/libft.a" added to the list of sources.

## Usage

Classic 42 Makefile:
````sh
make add	#compiles everything and the library "libft.a"
make clean	#removes all the .o files
make erase	#removes all the .o files and the library "libft.a"
make reset	#cleans everything in the project and compiles everything again
````

## Utility

A bit long to do at first but very useful at the start of each project.
